# Emoji Logger ðŸ˜‹
_oh no_

```toml
[dependencies]
emoji-logger = "0.1.0"
```

## What
With groundbreaking computer science, we have managed to bring emojis to your system logs!

Just
```rust
extern crate emoji_logger;
// ...
emoji_logger::init();
```
and emoji away!


## Why
Someone had to do it. If you have issues or suggestions, open an issue.

Thank you Sean McArthur for `pretty_env_log`, which this is based on.
